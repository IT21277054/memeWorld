        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Are you stuck in your room? <b>(Obviously).</b> Well, you’re at the right place!!<br>
            You will find any meme worthy enough to be showcased in our page.<br><br>

           
        
            We got together and thought of what we could do as a project <br> and we came up with this idea of making a meme page.<br> Everyone is stuck at home staring at the computer screen <br> pretending to listen to the ICS lecture <br>while we all know we don’t get anything they are saying xD.<br>
            We all know what website you will vote for<br> <b>*cough</b> <i>Obviously us.</i> <br><b>Enjoy…</b></p>
